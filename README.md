    This assignment is very difficult for me to hit every aspect of the project. Overall, the topic of Javascript has made me question my ability to learn and master it. I am only able to get this far because of the help from Manoli and my tutor. There are many aspects of this project that I simply don't understand despite going over the class activities. In order to full grasp the topic, I shall come back later to fix the assignment and to do it without help. For now, I shall submit this.
